Part necessary of the kerberos system, responsible for acessing the database and making the alterations.

This is the code that will reach your database.

### Attention

This project was developed with AWS in mind, so we use a few services that it offers, in this case SecretManager.

Changes are necessary if you are gonna run it any other way.
